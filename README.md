## Excluded from original drupal code
  - Starter kit. But you still can create sub theme. See [Developing themes](https://api.backdropcms.org/developing-themes)
  - Tooltip. Feature is here, but you need follow [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips) to make it work.
  - Popovers.  Feature is here, but you need follow [documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers) to make it work.
  - Anchors settings. I believe this one need to be done via module.
